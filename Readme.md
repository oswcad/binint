This app provides:

- How to represent natural binary numbers, that is numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., using a given amount of bits
- How to represent integers in two's complement form, that is negative and positive whole numbers using a given amount of bits


Inputs: 
- Pick the amount of bits to use. 
- Write a whole number and hit enter. For instance -3 and hit return or 7 and return
- Select either *Natural binary* or *2's complement*
